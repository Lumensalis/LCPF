# License
 
This is NOT an Open Source project.  The _only_ thing the license permits you
to use this for is your own personal projects.  You can _NOT_ share this
software _OR ANYTHING YOU BUILD USING IT_ with anyone else under
this license.

I will _probably_ change to a less restrictive license at some point, although 
it will probably _NOT_ allow any form of commercial use, especially selling 
any physical products including this software pre-installed.  I'd
prefer changing to an Open Source(ish) license, _if_ I can find one that
allows me to keep things free and easy _only_ for personal use.

If there is interest, I'll provide additional commercial license options.

Actual license is in [License.txt](LICENSE.txt).
